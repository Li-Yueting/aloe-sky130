Sourcing design .magicrc for technology sky130A ...
2 Magic internal units = 1 Lambda
Input style sky130(vendor): scaleFactor=2, multiplier=2
The following types are not handled by extraction and will be treated as non-electrical types:
    mvobsactive ubm 
Scaled tech values by 2 / 1 to match internal grid scaling
