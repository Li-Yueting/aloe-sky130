Usage: innovus [options]
[-abort_on_error]
	Exit if an error is detected at any point.
[-batch]
	No interactive prompt occurs. Exit after -execute and -files options
	are processed.
[-cds_lib_file <in_file>]
	Load in_file rather than the default cds.lib file in the current
	directory to obtain the names and locations of OpenAccess libraries.
[-stylus]
	Enable Common UI, Stylus flow kit, and Stylus metrics.
[-cpus <integer>]
	Number of cpus to use for multi-threading on current host.
[-disable_user_startup]
	Only read the init file in the installation hierarchy. Do not read
	init files in the home or current directory.
[-execute <Tcl_commands>]
	Tcl commands to execute at startup, before -files.
[-files <in_file_list>]
	One or more Tcl files to source at startup, after -execute. Set shell envar CDS_STYLUS_SOURCE_VERBOSE to 0 if you don't want the source command output to default to verbose in Stylus.
[-help]
	Write out the usage and options with brief descriptions.
[-lic_multi_cpu <lic_list>]
	Control which licenses to use for higher multi-cpu usage in priority
	order from left to right. The allowed license names are:
	"invs_cpu invs invsb fel fexl invs_dcpu"
[-lic_options <lic_list>]
	Ordered list for dynamic option license checkout in priority order
	from left to right. These are checked out when needed by a specific
	Tcl command. Legal names are:
	"invs_hier invs_ms invs_3d_ic invs_5nm invs_3nm invs_7nm invs_20nm invs_10nm invs_i20nm invs_i10nm invs_hfr invs_gigaplace qrcaa enclp encan enccco encng vdixl_capacity invs_pi invs_ml invs_ehfs invs_dfm invs_sc
	 tpsxl tpsl vtsxl vtsl vtsxm vtsesd vtsaa"
[-lic_startup <lic_list>]
	Request one of these licenses at startup in priority order from left
	to right. The supported licenses are:
	"invs invsb fexl vdixl vdi fel"
[-lic_startup_options <lic_list>]
	Additional option licenses needed at startup. The allowed license
	names are:
	"invs_hier invs_ms invs_3d_ic invs_5nm invs_3nm invs_7nm invs_20nm invs_10nm invs_i20nm invs_i10nm invs_hfr invs_gigaplace qrcaa enclp encan enccco encng vdixl_capacity invs_pi invs_ml invs_ehfs invs_dfm invs_sc
	 tpsxl tpsl vtsxl vtsl vtsxm vtsesd vtsaa"
[-lic_stack <integer>]
	Number of licenses to stack for stackable licenses.
[-log <prefix>]
	Prefix for the .log, .cmd, and .logv files. If 3 args are given like
	-log "a b c" then the 3 names are used without any extension added.
	If the .log file already exists, an integer is appended to all the
	names to make the files unique.
[-no_gui]
	Disable GUI and Tk support. GUI will not be available later in the
	session.
[-no_logv]
	Specifies that verbose log file will not be created.
[-no_cmd]
	Specifies that verbose command file will not be created.
[-overwrite]
	Overwrite an existing .log file (and associated .cmd, .logv files)
	instead of adding an integer to make the files unique.
[-version]
	Return program version information.
[-wait <minutes>]
	Number of minutes to wait for licenses before exiting. The default is 0.
